# Toko-HP-Journal-Gen

An HTML generator custom made for the Tokotas ARPG. This simple-to-use website will take a spreadsheet of artworks and the Tokotas which appear in them, and allow you to generate a pre-formatted HP Journal for any of Tokota in the file with the click of a button! It should save you lots of time and maybe even some visits to corrections.
